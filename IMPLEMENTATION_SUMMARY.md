**Workaround:** 
- Use continuous tracking (updates every 2 minutes)
- Each update gives fresh location
- Close enough for most safety scenarios

---

### Limitation 2: Not Fully Automatic
**What's Missing:** SMS/WhatsApp need manual send confirmation

**Workaround:**
- Browser security requires user action
- This actually prevents spam/abuse
- One-tap to send is quick enough

---

### Limitation 3: Requires Internet
**What's Missing:** Police station finder needs internet

**Workaround:**
- Emergency numbers (112, 1091) work offline
- "Call" buttons work without internet
- Can memorize key numbers

---

### Limitation 4: Battery Usage
**What's Missing:** Continuous tracking uses GPS (drains battery)

**Workaround:**
- Use only when needed
- Stop tracking when safe
- Bring power bank for long trips
- Safety > Battery life
